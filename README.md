VS Code keyboard shortcuts in .png form

First choose if you want the dark or light one, then either:


A:
1) Set as desktop background image/wallpaper
2) Toggle 'Show desktop to reference'
   (note: best to remove icons from desktop, they will be hard to read and obsure the image)

OR

B: 
1) Open the image in preview/slideshow/favorite image viewer
2) Use alt-tab (or appropriate key combo) to switch back and forth between VS Code and the image.
  (note: best to choose an image viewer that will display the image fullscreen without having to do any additional actions)
  
OR

C:
1) Have desired image laser etched into your retina.
  (note: be sure to flip the image horizontally first!)
